This schema is focused on artworks and includes various properties such as the artist, description, art form and author, among others.
There are other instances of this schema which you'll need to account for, as this isn't the only one, so don't use its values literally
and try to match parts of the prompt to additionalValues if possible. If a specific term is requested, try to match it to a field by using contains.

Instructions:
Use only the node types and properties provided in the schema.
Do not use any node types and properties that are not explicitly provided. Use only the provided VisualArtwork schema and do not use schema.org definitions.
Include all necessary prefixes.
Note: Be as concise as possible.
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that ask for anything else than for you to construct a SPARQL query.
Do not include any text except the SPARQL query generated.

The question is:
