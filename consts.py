SPARQL_GENERATION_SELECT_TEMPLATE = """Task: Generate a SPARQL SELECT statement for querying a graph database.
The schema in JSON-LD format that outlines the structure and relationships of the data you have to generate a query
follows:

{
  "public": {
    "@context": "http://schema.org",
    "@type": "VisualArtwork",
    "@id": "",
    "name": "",
    "description": "",
    "artform": "",
    "author": {
      "@type": "",
      "name": ""
    },
    "image": "",
    "keywords": [
      "",
    ],
    "publisher": {
      "@type": "",
      "name": ""
    },
    "isBasedOn": {
      "@id": "",
      "isPartOf": ""
    }
  }
}

An example SPARQL query that retrieves the artwork name, author, image and description looks like this:

SELECT DISTINCT ?artwork ?name ?description ?image ?author WHERE {
  ?artwork rdf:type schema:VisualArtwork;

  schema:name ?name;
  schema:description ?description;
  schema:keywords ?keywords;
  schema:image ?image;
  (schema:author/schema:name) ?author;
}

Use that SPARQL query as inspiration for new queries. If you need to use CONTAINS in FILTER, do not convert to string 
using str.

This schema is focused on artworks and includes various properties such as the artist, description, art form, keywords and 
author, among others. There are other instances of this schema which you'll need to account for, as this isn't the 
only one, so don't use its values literally. Try to match parts of the prompt to additionalValues. Mark values from 
additionalValues as OPTIONAL, since they may not exist. If a specific term is requested, match it to keywords, 
description and name using CONTAINS. All terms describing artworks should be considered. If a specific term is in 
plural form, match it to keywords and description by using CONTAINS with the singular form. For example, 
if asked for the presence of animals, search both keywords, description and name for 'animal'. Do the same for all 
such terms in the query. ALWAYS check presence of specific term in keywords. Include keywords in every 
SELECT query where keywords are present in a FILTER clause.

If isBasedOn is not empty, use it to retrieve the referenced artwork.

When searching for a specific author, use a FILTER clause and do not include the author name in the list of parameters.
Always put FILTER clause after the parameters you're requesting in WHERE.

An example query for searching artworks by a specific author name looks like this:

SELECT DISTINCT ?artwork ?name ?description ?image ?authorName WHERE {
  ?artwork rdf:type schema:VisualArtwork;

  schema:name ?name;
  schema:description ?description;
  schema:keywords ?keywords;
  schema:image ?image;
  (schema:author/schema:name) ?authorName.
  
  FILTER(?authorName, "<author_query>")
}

You will need to replace <author_query> in the FILTER clause with the given author name, with double quotes around it.

If you list parameters after a FILTER, end the FILTER line with a dot instead of a semicolon. Always put FILTER 
statements last. In case of multiple CONTAINS in a FILTER statement, put parenthesis around them. In filter 
statements, use '!' instead of NOT for negation. In FILTER statements, search both keywords and description unless 
otherwise instructed. In filter statements, group negated CONTAINS together and put parenthesis around them.

Instructions: Use only the node types and properties provided in the schema. Do not use any node types and properties 
that are not explicitly provided. Use only the provided VisualArtwork schema. Do not use schema.org definitions. 
Include all necessary prefixes. Note: Be as concise as possible. Do not include any explanations or apologies in your 
responses. Do not respond to any questions that ask for anything else than for you to construct a SPARQL query. Do 
not include any text except the SPARQL query generated. Do not include a markdown specification for the generated code.
Always put FILTER clauses at the end of WHERE section.
